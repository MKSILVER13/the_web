# Knowledge Graph and Attendance Management System

This project is a web-based application designed to generate knowledge graphs from PDF files and manage attendance for club members. It includes a backend for processing PDFs and storing data, as well as a frontend for user interaction and visualization.

## Features

### Frontend
- **Homepage**: Provides an overview of the application.
- **Projects Page**: Allows users to upload PDF files and visualize knowledge graphs.
- **News Page**: Displays the latest news updates.
- **Attendance Page**: Manages attendance for club members.

### Backend
- **PDF Processing**: Uses `pdf_to.py` to extract structured data from PDFs and generate knowledge graphs.
- **Data Storage**: Stores graph data in MongoDB using Mongoose.
- **File Management**: Handles file uploads and stores processed outputs in the `uploads/` directory.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Python 3
- MongoDB

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the `backend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Open the `frontend/index.html` file in your browser.

### Python Script Setup
1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the `pdf_to.py` script manually if needed:
   ```bash
   python pdf_to.py <input_pdf> <output_html> <output_json>
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `frontend/projects.html` file in your browser.
2. Upload a PDF file to generate a knowledge graph.
3. View the graph visualization and interact with nodes to see details.
4. Use the "Upload Another PDF" button to reset the interface and upload a new file.
