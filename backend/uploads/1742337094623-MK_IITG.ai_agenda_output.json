I chose the Events Head role as my first preference in the POR. Since my first year in college, I’ve been involved in many projects. I started as a member of Kriti, representing Lohit Hostel, and later became one of the managers for the Tenothron workshop module. I’ve successfully organized four three-day workshops during Techniece. Additionally, I participated in Inter IIT Tech Meet 13.0 as part of the PS Pathway High Prep team, and I have actively taken part in the Inter IIT Bootcamp as well as the PyTorch and Hugging Face workshop. These experiences have not only given me the chance to organize events but also to learn from participating in them. They have helped me develop strong skills in coordinating teams, delegating tasks, and creating an engaging, collaborative environment within the club.",

Organize engaging campus-wide hackathons and workshops to spark interest in AI/ML. 3. Actively involve freshers through regular meetings, tasks, discussions, and learning sessions. 4. Keep track of ongoing projects — 2 major projects for freshers and a major project by the Heads for Techevince next year. 5. Post small quizzes regularly on the website and share monthly leaderboards on Instagram to keep everyone motivated. 6. Resume MLRW in March next year. My aim is to build a more active and collaborative AI community on campus, making AI/ML not just about career goals but also about genuine curiosity and real-world applications.",

Once the games are built, the IITG.ai club will step in. Our goal? To develop AI models capable of playing — and hopefully beating the games. It’s a showdown — if our AI outsmarts and beats the game, we win. If the game proves too tough for our AI, the GameDev team takes the crown.",

This may not be Inter IIT level but it will give the members a taste of it and it also encourage them in this project. Collaboration : We may collaborate with other clubs of IITG. Group Formation : A form will be shared, and members must submit a report outlining their project approaches and preferences by 6th February. Based on these reports, groups will be formed. Project Content : The topics will be finalized in a joint meeting before Alcheringa.",
