Since my first year in college, I\u2019ve been involved in many projects. I started as a member of Kriti, representing Lohit Hostel, and later became one of the managers for the Tenothron workshop module. I\u2019ve successfully organized four three-day workshops during Techniece. Additionally, I participated in Inter IIT Tech Meet 13.0 as part of the PS Pathway High Prep team, and I have actively taken part in the Inter IIT Bootcamp as well as the PyTorch and Hugging Face workshop.
